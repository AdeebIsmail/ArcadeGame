Please use Java SDK 8, otherwise the project will not work. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

If you are using intellij, hit ctrl + alt + s + shift, go to Project and change the sdk to version 1.8.x and make sure the Project language level is at 8

WASD to move, IJKL to shoot the arrow. P will pick up the gold and once you have done that, walk back to the ladder and press C to go up. If you die, press N to start a new game. Press 8 to turn on cheat mode. To win, you need to pick up the gold and escape. The black pits and the Wumpus will kill you. 

If you are running the exe, download the whole repo and run the exe. Make sure the exe is outside the "Images" folder. To activate the cheat mode, do Shift + 8. Do not have CAPS LOCK on.
